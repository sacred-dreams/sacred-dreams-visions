    <h2>THE ROLE OF SACRED DREAMS IN MARRIAGE</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Sacred dreams</strong> have played a significant role in the context of marriage in the Bible. Dreams in the Bible are often used to convey important messages from God, and these messages can often have significant implications for the relationships and marriages of those involved. In this response, we will explore some examples of sacred dreams in the Bible and how they relate to marriage.</p>

    <p><strong>One of the most important sacred dreams</strong> in the Bible is the dream of Joseph in Matthew 1:18-25. In this dream, an angel appears to Joseph and tells him that Mary, his fianc√©, is pregnant through the Holy Spirit and that he should not be afraid to take her as his wife. This dream is significant in the context of marriage because it shows how God can guide and reassure us in our relationships and marriages, even when things seem uncertain or difficult.</p>

    <p><strong>Another famous example of sacred dreams</strong> in the Bible is the dream of Jacob in Genesis 28:10-22. In this dream, God appears to Jacob and promises him that he will have many descendants and his offspring will be blessed. This dream is significant in the context of marriage because it shows how God's promises can be fulfilled through the relationships and marriages of his people. Jacob later marries Leah and Rachel, who become the mothers of his many children.</p>

    <p><strong>The book of Song of Solomon</strong> is a beautiful poetic representation of the love between a husband and wife. Throughout the book, the couple expresses their love for each other and the deep connection that they share. While there are no specific examples of sacred dreams in this book, the imagery and language used to describe the couple's relationship suggest that their love is blessed by God and that their marriage is a reflection of the divine love between God and his people.</p>

    <p><strong>Another example of sacred dreams</strong> in the Bible is the dream of Pharaoh in Genesis 41:1-36. In this dream, Pharaoh sees seven thin cows devouring seven fat cows, and seven withered ears of grain consuming seven healthy ears of grain. Joseph interprets this dream to mean that there will be seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine. This dream is significant in the context of marriage because it shows how God can use his people to bring about his plans, even in the most unexpected ways. Joseph goes on to marry and have two sons, who become an important part of God's plan for the nation of Israel.</p>

    <p><strong>In the New Testament</strong>, Paul writes extensively about marriage and relationships. In Ephesians 5:22-33, he describes the relationship between husband and wife in terms of Christ's relationship with the church. He writes that wives should submit to their husbands, and husbands should love their wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her. This passage is significant in the context of sacred dreams because it shows how God's plan for marriage is rooted in his love for his people and his desire for them to live in harmony and mutual respect.</p>

    <p><strong>In the book of Ruth</strong>, we see an example of how God can use the relationships and marriages of his people to bring about his plan. Ruth, a Moabite woman, marries Boaz, a wealthy landowner in Bethlehem. Through their marriage, Ruth becomes the great-grandmother of King David, who is an important figure in the history of Israel. This story is significant in the context of sacred dreams because it shows how God can use even the most unlikely relationships and marriages to bring about his plan for his people.</p>

    <p><strong>In the book of Hosea</strong>, we see a powerful example of how God's love for his people is reflected in the relationship between a husband and wife. Hosea is commanded by God to marry a prostitute named Gomer, who is unfaithful to him throughout their marriage. Despite her infidelity, Hosea remains faithful to Gomer and continues to love her, just as God remains faithful to his people even when they turn away from him. This story is significant in the context of sacred dreams because it shows how God's love for his people is reflected in the love between a husband and wife, even in the most difficult circumstances.</p>

    <p><strong>In the book of Proverbs</strong>, we see many examples of wisdom and advice for relationships and marriages. Proverbs 31:10-31 describes the qualities of a virtuous wife, who is praised for her hard work, generosity, and wisdom. This passage is significant in the context of sacred dreams because it shows how God's plan for marriage is rooted in the values of wisdom, hard work, and generosity.</p>

    <p><strong>In the book of Genesis</strong>, we see another example of sacred dreams in the story of Abraham and Sarah. In Genesis 18:1-15, three visitors appear to Abraham and Sarah and tell them that Sarah, who is barren, will have a son. Sarah laughs at the idea, but the visitors tell her that nothing is impossible for God. This story is significant in the context of sacred dreams because it shows how God's promises can be fulfilled through the relationships and marriages of his people, even in the most unlikely circumstances.</p>

    <p><strong>In conclusion</strong>, sacred dreams have played a significant role in the context of marriage in the Bible. Through the stories and examples we have explored, we see how God's love, wisdom, and promises are reflected in the relationships and marriages of his people. Whether through the guidance and reassurance of dreams or the values and qualities of virtuous marriages, the Bible shows us that God's plan for marriage is rooted in his love for his people and his desire for them to live in harmony and mutual respect.</p>

    <h2>Family Devotion Prayer</h2>
    <h2>MARRIAGE! MAN HAS STRAYED FROM THE PATH</h2>
    <p><strong>Heavenly Father,</strong> we come before you with humble hearts, seeking 
    your guidance and blessings on the sacred institution of marriage. 
    As we reflect upon the visions and messages received, we recognize 
    the urgency of restoring honor and value to the gift of marriage, 
    as intended by your divine plan.</p>
                                                                    
    <p><strong>Loving God,</strong> we ask for your wisdom and strength to help us honor and cherish the gift of marriage.

    <p><strong>Lord Jesus,</strong> we lift up all couples, parents, and children in prayer. May your Holy Spirit dwell within our hearts and homes, guiding us to uphold the sanctity of marriage with fidelity, love, and selflessness. Let the painful expressions on your face serve as a constant reminder of the need to nurture and protect the bonds of matrimony.</p>

    <p><strong>Grant us</strong> the grace to resist the temptations that threaten the sacredness of marriage. Help us to live in accordance with your will and to honor the commitment we have made to one another.</p>

    <p><strong>May children</strong> receive the grace to honor and respect their parents. Grant them the courage to face life's trials with resilience and the humility to seek guidance when needed. May they grow in love and understanding, building a foundation of trust and connection with their families.</p>

    <p><strong>As families</strong> come together in prayer and fasting, may the model of the Holy Family of Nazareth inspire us to emulate their virtues of love, patience, and unity. May this dedicated time of devotion be a source of grace, strengthening the bonds between spouses and deepening the love within families.</p>

    <p><strong>In our daily lives,</strong> help us to prioritize the bonds we share. May our homes be filled with laughter, understanding, and the warmth of your divine presence. Guide us in our words and actions so that they may reflect the love we receive from you.</p>

    <p><strong>Lord, we</strong> entrust our marriages and families to your loving care. May the message conveyed through these sacred prayers reach the hearts of your Church, inspiring a renewed commitment to the sacredness of marriage. We ask for your protection against the destructive forces that threaten the unity of families and the fabric of society.
    As we embark on this journey together, may our marriages flourish, our relationships deepen, and our families thrive. In your name, we offer this prayer, trusting in your infinite wisdom and boundless love. Amen.</p>

    <p><strong>AUGUST 1998</strong> 
     
    <p>While asleep, I saw heaven opened and I saw the Almighty God sitting on His throne. He had in his right hand a chalice and in his left hand, a book. He rode towards me on the clouds. As he approached me, I felt terribly afraid, shivered and within me, my blood began to cloth. Then I noticed that the distance between his throne in the sky and the earth were I was, was so vast. When He finally got to were I was, he lifted up his right hand and poured the content of the chalice over the earth. Immediately, I noticed that the whole earth was filled with a large body of bloody water. The bloody sea was bubbling like water at 100 degrees Celsius. At this terrible sight, the vision faded from my sight.</p>

    <p><strong>July 09, 2000</strong> 
      
 <p>While asleep, I heard a very soft calm voice call out to me 'Atem'. Immediately, I recognized the voice that it was the Lord calling me and I answered 'Yes Lord.' When I answered the call, I immediately found myself standing at the church yard, in front of the Church. Then the Lord said to me 'Look at the wall.' I looked at the wall on my right carefully and the Lord questioned me saying 'What have you seen?' I answered 'A small cross with Jesus crucified on it'. The Lord then said to me 'Go and take it.'  Immediately, I left for the crucifix. When I got close to the wall, I saw a great light from the wall. Within the light stood Jesus Christ. I realized that the entire wall was Jesus Christ himself filled with intense bright light. I also noticed that the wall was not build of blocks as I had earlier seen but only of light from Jesus Christ. The entire wall was filled with intense bright light. I saw Jesus standing within the light filled wall. His appearance was golden and the light of his countenance was so great to my sight.  Then, I saw two golden hands protruding from the wall bearing the golden crucifix. Then the Lord said to me 'stretch out your hands and receive it.'  I stretch out my hands as instructed and opened my palms and the golden crucifix was placed in my palms. Immediately as I received the crucifix into my palms, I noticed that the intensity of the light from the wall which was Christ himself increased. The beauty of his expression in my sight and the magnificent light from Him kept me in amazement. As I stood amazed, blood began to ooze from the crucifix in my palms. Then Jesus said to me 'Drink the blood'. Immediately I drank the blood from the cross as Jesus instructed me to do.  The Lord then told me to bow prostrated three times and worship Him. I did and the Lord then made a solemn promise to me saying 'Today, I shall grant you a great miracle and this will be the sign of my promise.' Then He asked me to shake off my feet against the dust. I did and he gave me a sign saying this shall be the sign of my promise to you. Then, He told me to rise and go.</p>

    <p><strong>December 11, 2000</strong> 
      
 <p>At about 10:00pm. I sat in front of our house and was praying with my head bowed low when suddenly, a breeze blew over me and I raised my head to see what it was. As I looked up to see what it was that blew pass by me, I saw the sky extremely brighter than I had ever seen. This strange sight pulled my attention to continue watching at the sky. As I watch on, I suddenly saw the moon coming out of the sky. I also noticed that there was a strange thing within the moon. It was a lions head as I finally saw it. This lions head began to move round and round within the moon. Finally after a number of turns, I saw the Holy Face of Jesus appearing from within the moon. It appeared fully and covered the whole face of the moon. His expression was filled with pains and sorrow. There were wounds all over his face and the wounds were all bleeding. At this sight, I was terrified and fell on my knees and began to pray and weep saying Lord Jesus have mercy on your people, Lord Jesus have mercy on your people. As I continued to pray this prayer, I saw later that his face had changed and there were no more bleeding wounds on his face again. His face was pure and shining with no spot or stain and his hair was looking very beautiful. At this sight, the vision faded from my sight and I head a voice say to me get up. Then I rose.</p>

    <p><strong>November 9, 2010, 3:30am</strong> 
      
 <p>In my vision, I heard the Lord saying to me My gift of marriage to man has lost its honor and value as I intended. The painful expressions of my face that you saw are equivalent to the pains couples are inflicting on my sacred heart. The bleeding wounds on my face that you saw, show the extend of infidelity that is existing amongst couples, broken homes and marriages, lack of parental hood in the family, and the absence of true love amongst the couples.  I want my church to take away this pain from my sacred heart, to restore the honor and value of marriage as I had from the beginning when I gave this sacred gift to man. Take this message to my church. As for you, set aside a day of fasting and prayer in your family. On this day, you and your family should fast and pray. On this day of family devotion, you and your wife should abstain from sex. This will enable you to bring up your family in the model of the Holy Family of Nazareth. You must keep this day sacred for the purpose of honoring and sanctifying your marriage and family before me. You should also keep your marriage bond secret. All families on earth should do the same in other to honor and maintain their marriages before me. Once every month, all couples within each community should assemble and pray together. Go and give this message to my church.</p>

 <p>On this day at 5:00am the following message came to me in a vision.  I saw a book open and on the open page, I saw the following message; Sale! The body of Christ. The one who made it says; Christian marriage has become a sacrilege. Behold I want to make everything new. Many Christians are practicing Bigamy. The marriage devotion should be a sacramental. Many Christians now have no regards for the Ten Commandments.  My Commandments should be framed in every home where every member of the household can behold them.</p>

    <p><strong>July 28, 2019</strong> 
      
 <p>In my vision I saw the earth being destroyed by God. God cause the sun to emit extremely hot rays which were burning and killing every thing on earth. The heat rays also cause the earth to split into two halves and when this happened, I saw beneath the earth a huge sea of fire. Then I fell down on my knees and began to cry to God to have mercy on the world saying 'Lord Jesus have mercy. Lord Jesus have mercy.' As I was crying to Jesus, the destruction increased and the rays became more hotter. Then Jesus said to me 'look over'. I looked and saw something like a huge alter at the center of the earth. Beneath the alter was a shelter. I said to myself even if I run to the shelter, the heat rays will still destroy it and kill me. But as soon as I finished saying this, Jesus said to me 'Atem run as fast as you can into the shelter otherwise the heat rays will kill you.' I rose from my knees and ran very fast into the shelter. When I got inside I saw several people who had been saved from the destruction already inside. Then Jesus said to me 'The cross I gave you is my message which I gave you to take to my church. Take the message to my church.' This vision occurred again twice two months later in different occasions.
